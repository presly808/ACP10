java.io.*;

    class File
    absolute and relative paths (differences)

    byte Stream (InputStream, OutputStream)
    char streams (Reader, Writer)

    see design patterns Adapter and Decorator

    !!! always close OutputStream and Writer

3. Implement class FileHelper               window analog
       - show all available commands        help
       - changeCurrentLocation              cd
       - find file(dir)                     find
       - show directoryContent              dir
       - show file (content)                type
       - delete file or dir                 del , rd
       - create dir                         mkdir
       - create file                        ? )))
       - show folder structure              tree
       - copy file                          copy
       - compare content of files           fc

       * implement commands redirection
       http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/redirection.mspx?mfr=true

       - deepFind (do search in file name and in file content by keyword)
           * result of search can be written into file

       -* find in file system without recursion
       -* show content of folder
          ex.
           video - 70%
           audio - 10%
           document - 5%
           target - 15%

4. Implement Java Console Commander using class above (FileHelper)
    use design pattern MVC, see example https://github.com/presly808/ACP6/tree/master/src/main/java/ua/artcode/kassa


5*. Do Remote Java Console Commander
 using class Socket and ServerSocket
